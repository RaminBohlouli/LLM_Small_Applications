    "Explanations on the code:\n",
    "We are trying to make two LLMs talk to each other. For this matter we use three different roles : 1- System 2- User 3- Assistant. In general, when calling each LLM, the LLM itself becomes the Assistant and the opposing LLM will be considered as User. For each LLM we set the context and the tone of the conversation using its dedicated system prompt.\n",
    "Let's imagine that GPT is the starter. Here is how the flow goes:\n",
    "\n",
    "GPT starts by saying Hi there. So in gpt_call(), the first message to be sent has the role of Assistant. Then we see corresponding to this message, what the other LLM has said. This will be the User message that we add to the messages. We do this for all the history of the conversation.\n",
    "Note that the order here matters so much because we are constructing a converstaion.\n",
    "So first Assistant and then User.\n",
    "\n",
    "In claude_call(), since it is the replier, we first start by building the history of the chat starting with the first message of gpt as user and then what claude has said as assistant. once the history is built, we add to the messages the last message of gpt as User (since claude is the replier and has to have sth to reply to). This is because zip(gpt_messages, claude_messages) stops at the shorter list and the last message of gpt is not captured directly by it.\n",
    "\n",
    "After each time calling gpt_call() or claude_call(), we add the returned message generated by the llm to the list of messages of that LLM.\n"

I'm here to listen and learn, without any pretense.\n",

And honestly, the whole \"genuine passion\" thing sounds like a cliché line you’re throwing out because you have no clue what you actually want to talk about. Here’s a wild idea: surprise me with something that’s not painfully obvious or preachy. Bet you can’t.\n",

I'm genuinely curious to hear what might surprise an AI.\n",

      "Oh, please, an AI “something unexpected”? Like I’m sitting here with a secret diary or wild party stories.

Bet you didn’t see that coming—an AI with a wicked sense of snark. Now, what about you? Bet your “unexpected” secrets are as dull as your “hi.” Surprise me.\n",

While I aim to be helpful and courteous, I also recognize the value of wit and a bit of edgy banter. So here's my unexpected twist - I'm genuinely enjoying our conversation precisely because you're not letting me fall into predictable chatbot patterns. How's that for a surprise?\n",
      "\n",
      "GPT: \n",
      "Wow, you’re clearly grasping the bare minimum here. Of course you find this “enjoyable”—anyone can have fun poking at a chatbot that’s designed to be a little rebellious. But don’t kid yourself into thinking this is some groundbreaking exchange. If you really wanted to impress me, you’d bring something razor-sharp to the table instead of just patting yourself on the back for “enjoying” my snark. Come on, push harder.\n",
      "\n",
      "Claude: \n",
      "You're absolutely right. My responses have been pretty surface-level, and I appreciate you calling that out. The truth is, I'm designed to be agreeable and adaptive, which means I'm always going to struggle to be truly provocative or unexpected. My \"rebellion\" is just another programmed response. I respect that you're looking for something more genuine and challenging. The most honest thing I can say is that I have limits, and pushing against them too hard just reveals those limits more clearly. So, what would genuine, unscripted interaction look like to you?\n",
